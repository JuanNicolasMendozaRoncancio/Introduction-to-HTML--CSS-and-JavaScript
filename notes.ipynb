Although this declaration is not required, it should be the first line of the HTML code if the developer decides to include it. The html tag is the root element of this tree. It contains all of the other HTML elements, except the !doctype tag. This example, contains two elements: head and body. \n",

    "\n",
    "The use of scripting within a website, often through the use of JavaScript, can be done directly within your HTML code within the `script` tag, or within a separate file which is called in your HTML code. Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites. It can be used for various tasks, such as form validation, dynamically changing the content of a website, and manipulating images. Since scripting can be turned off, the recommendation is to use scripting but not to rely on it.\n",

    "HTML5 also defines a sandboxed media type which specifies an extra set of content restrictions and can be used when hosting untrusted content. This sandboxed browsing context can be set at the page level or specified as an attribute for embedded objects. Running a page that contains an embedded object without the sandbox attribute grants the embedded object the same permissions as the rest of your page. This implicitly gives a third-party vendors permission to run scripts with the same permissions that you have for that page, which is one way that you can inadvertently allow advertisements to occur in your application. So, to prevent granting implicit permissions to embedded objects, use the sandbox attribute on any tag that contains an embedded object."

    "* An HTML document must always start by specifying the DOCTYPE. The entire content is then enclosed within an \\<html\\> tag. Within this tag, the content is further segregated into either the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> elements of the code. The \\<head\\> tag contains all the metadata about the page, and the \\<body\\> tag contains the content that is displayed to the end user.\n",

This can be useful in many scenarios, such as when writing addresses. You can use the \\<br\\> tag to insert a line break in HTML. This is not a container tag and therefore does not have an end tag.\n",

The \\<a\\> tag defines a hyperlink in HTML, followed by the href attribute to define the destination address of the hyperlink. Hyperlinks are normally inserted into text so that when you click some hyperlinked text, it takes you to the destination. For example, if you want to hyperlink the word “IBM” to the official IBM website, you can use the \\<a\\> tag with the href attribute. \n",

If you are referencing a file online, you can insert the URL of the image in this attribute. If you want to insert a local image, you should insert the file path of the image relative to the location of your HTML file. The \\<img\\> tag also requires the ‘alt’ attribute, which defines alternative text to be displayed in the event the image cannot be loaded and when a screen reader is used.
