    "The !DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Although this declaration is not required, it should be the first line of the HTML code if the developer decides to include it. The html tag is the root element of this tree. It contains all of the other HTML elements, except the !doctype tag. This example, contains two elements: head and body. \n",

    "## HTML Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of scripting within a website, often through the use of JavaScript, can be done directly within your HTML code within the `script` tag, or within a separate file which is called in your HTML code. Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites. It can be used for various tasks, such as form validation, dynamically changing the content of a website, and manipulating images. Since scripting can be turned off, the recommendation is to use scripting but not to rely on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML5 also defines a sandboxed media type which specifies an extra set of content restrictions and can be used when hosting untrusted content. This sandboxed browsing context can be set at the page level or specified as an attribute for embedded objects. Running a page that contains an embedded object without the sandbox attribute grants the embedded object the same permissions as the rest of your page. This implicitly gives a third-party vendors permission to run scripts with the same permissions that you have for that page, which is one way that you can inadvertently allow advertisements to occur in your application. So, to prevent granting implicit permissions to embedded objects, use the sandbox attribute on any tag that contains an embedded object."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An HTML document must always start by specifying the DOCTYPE. The entire content is then enclosed within an \\<html\\> tag. Within this tag, the content is further segregated into either the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> elements of the code. The \\<head\\> tag contains all the metadata about the page, and the \\<body\\> tag contains the content that is displayed to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can define the browser title using the \\<title\\> tag, which is placed within the \\<head\\> section of your HTML markup as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML headings are defined with the following tags: \\<h1\\>, \\<h2\\>, \\<h3\\>, \\<h4\\>, \\<h5\\>, and \\<h6\\>. The number in these tags specifies the importance, with \\<h1\\> being the largest heading and \\<h6\\> being the smallest heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \\<p\\> tag should be used to insert text into your HTML document. This element stands for paragraph and includes any text content, whether it is a single word or a 10-page essay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A line break is used to complete one line and continue the remaining text at the start of a new line, like what was just done here. This can be useful in many scenarios, such as when writing addresses. You can use the \\<br\\> tag to insert a line break in HTML. This is not a container tag and therefore does not have an end tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web pages can link to other pages or other places on the same page via a hyperlink. The \\<a\\> tag defines a hyperlink in HTML, followed by the href attribute to define the destination address of the hyperlink. Hyperlinks are normally inserted into text so that when you click some hyperlinked text, it takes you to the destination. For example, if you want to hyperlink the word “IBM” to the official IBM website, you can use the \\<a\\> tag with the href attribute. \n",
    "    - If you want a hyperlink to open a certain destination in a new tab, you can do so by adding _\"target=\"_blank\"__ to the \\<a\\> tag as follows:\n",
    "    - Hyperlinks are also able to link to other places on the same page. You can link to the top of the current page in either of the following two ways:\n",
    "        ```html\n",

    "        <a href=\"#top\">Top of Page</a>\n",
    "        ```\n",

Both external images (for instance, from the internet) and local images (for instance, files saved on your computer) can be used in this tag. To add an image, you need to know the image file name and include it in the ‘src’ attribute. The ‘src’ attribute specifies an external resource that you want to link, such as the URL of an image. If you are referencing a file online, you can insert the URL of the image in this attribute. If you want to insert a local image, you should insert the file path of the image relative to the location of your HTML file. The \\<img\\> tag also requires the ‘alt’ attribute, which defines alternative text to be displayed in the event the image cannot be loaded and when a screen reader is used.

However, it is useful in styling all navigational elements, as well as omitting the content for certain functionalities, such as with screen reader.\n",

It contains one or more \\<source\\> tags with different audio sources (e.g. MP3, WAV), so the browser can select the first supported source to play.
