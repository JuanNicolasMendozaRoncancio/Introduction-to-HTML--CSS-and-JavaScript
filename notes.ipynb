    "The !DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Although this declaration is not required, it should be the first line of the HTML code if the developer decides to include it. The html tag is the root element of this tree. It contains all of the other HTML elements, except the !doctype tag. This example, contains two elements: head and body. \n",

    "## HTML Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of scripting within a website, often through the use of JavaScript, can be done directly within your HTML code within the `script` tag, or within a separate file which is called in your HTML code. Scripting provides a more interactive user experience when browsing websites. It can be used for various tasks, such as form validation, dynamically changing the content of a website, and manipulating images. Since scripting can be turned off, the recommendation is to use scripting but not to rely on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML5 also defines a sandboxed media type which specifies an extra set of content restrictions and can be used when hosting untrusted content. This sandboxed browsing context can be set at the page level or specified as an attribute for embedded objects. Running a page that contains an embedded object without the sandbox attribute grants the embedded object the same permissions as the rest of your page. This implicitly gives a third-party vendors permission to run scripts with the same permissions that you have for that page, which is one way that you can inadvertently allow advertisements to occur in your application. So, to prevent granting implicit permissions to embedded objects, use the sandbox attribute on any tag that contains an embedded object."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* An HTML document must always start by specifying the DOCTYPE. The entire content is then enclosed within an \\<html\\> tag. Within this tag, the content is further segregated into either the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> elements of the code. The \\<head\\> tag contains all the metadata about the page, and the \\<body\\> tag contains the content that is displayed to the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can define the browser title using the \\<title\\> tag, which is placed within the \\<head\\> section of your HTML markup as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* HTML headings are defined with the following tags: \\<h1\\>, \\<h2\\>, \\<h3\\>, \\<h4\\>, \\<h5\\>, and \\<h6\\>. The number in these tags specifies the importance, with \\<h1\\> being the largest heading and \\<h6\\> being the smallest heading.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \\<p\\> tag should be used to insert text into your HTML document. This element stands for paragraph and includes any text content, whether it is a single word or a 10-page essay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A line break is used to complete one line and continue the remaining text at the start of a new line, like what was just done here. This can be useful in many scenarios, such as when writing addresses. You can use the \\<br\\> tag to insert a line break in HTML. This is not a container tag and therefore does not have an end tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Web pages can link to other pages or other places on the same page via a hyperlink. The \\<a\\> tag defines a hyperlink in HTML, followed by the href attribute to define the destination address of the hyperlink. Hyperlinks are normally inserted into text so that when you click some hyperlinked text, it takes you to the destination. For example, if you want to hyperlink the word “IBM” to the official IBM website, you can use the \\<a\\> tag with the href attribute. \n",
    "    - If you want a hyperlink to open a certain destination in a new tab, you can do so by adding _\"target=\"_blank\"__ to the \\<a\\> tag as follows:\n",
    "    - Hyperlinks are also able to link to other places on the same page. You can link to the top of the current page in either of the following two ways:\n",
    "        ```html\n",

    "        <a href=\"#top\">Top of Page</a>\n",
    "        ```\n",

Both external images (for instance, from the internet) and local images (for instance, files saved on your computer) can be used in this tag. To add an image, you need to know the image file name and include it in the ‘src’ attribute. The ‘src’ attribute specifies an external resource that you want to link, such as the URL of an image. If you are referencing a file online, you can insert the URL of the image in this attribute. If you want to insert a local image, you should insert the file path of the image relative to the location of your HTML file. The \\<img\\> tag also requires the ‘alt’ attribute, which defines alternative text to be displayed in the event the image cannot be loaded and when a screen reader is used.

Which can include navigation bars, forms, and grids and to create dynamic and responsive websites, which can make a website suitable for any screen size.\n",

    "There are two types of CSS frameworks: \n",
    "- Utility frameworks and component frameworks. Using no framework at all and just using plain CSS (also called Vanilla CSS) requires you to write all the styling on your own. This gives you the freedom to style everything exactly as you want it, but also requires a lot of time and effort, as you must style every component. An alternative to this is to use a utility framework, which gives you “utility” classes that scope to a single CSS property. This makes it easier to apply CSS properties directly in your HTML code, which can save a lot of time while still giving you the freedom to style components as you wish. Component frameworks provide you with pre-styled components and templates which are easy to add to any website.  Utility-first frameworks provide you with an easy way to reference CSS properties. These typically come in the form of classes, called utility classes, which scope to single-purpose CSS classes. Instead of having to write out the entire CSS property, utility-first frameworks allow you to use a property by referencing its corresponding class within the “class” attribute of your desired HTML element. For example, instead of using the “text-align: center;” CSS property in your code, a utility-first framework might have a self-descriptive class, such as “text-center”, which does the same thing when added to the ”class” attribute of an HTML element.  A popular utility-first CSS framework used today is Tailwind CSS. It is packed with classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup. For example, say you want to style a link to indicate it’s dangerous. You could underline the link text and change the text color to be red, as well as make the link a darker shade of red when hovered over.\n",

One of the most popular component CSS frameworks in use today is called Bootstrap. It allows you to build fast, responsive sites with a feature-packed frontend toolkit. If we take our example of adding a red danger link to your webpage which we saw earlier, we can see how much easier this would be with Bootstrap. "

    "Here are a couple of things JavaScript is known for. Manipulating the DOM: JavaScript can change a web page's content structure and style. It's like having a magic wand for web elements. Handling events: From button clicks to mouse movements, JavaScript can respond to various user interactions, making websites more engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a fundamental part of web development and is used in various ways. Enhancing user experience: \n",
    "\n",
    "* JavaScript can validate form data, create interactive forms, and provide real time feedback to users.\n",
    "* Dynamic web content: It can load new content without refreshing the entire page like real time social media feeds. \n",
    "* Animations and visual effects: JavaScript can create animations, sliders, and other visual effects to improve website aesthetics. \n",
    "* Web applications: Many web apps such as Google Docs, Netflix, or Trello, rely heavily on JavaScript to provide a smooth and responsive user experience."

    "![HTML example](Images\\imageVI.png)\n",

    "* Let was introduced in ES6 and provides block level scoping. This means, that a variable declared with let is only available within the block enclosed by curly braces in which it is defined. This scope is more predictable and less error prone. \n",

It also has block level scoping. Const variables are often used for values that should not change, such as mathematical constants or references to immutable objects.\n",

    "    - A string is enclosed in single or double quotes. \n",
    "    - Number represents both integers and floating-point numbers. \n",

    "    - Undefined represents a variable that has been declared, but hasn't been assigned a value. Null represents an empty value or absence of any object value.  \n",
